## Objective
* To learn the basics of React
  * Followed along with Fireship's Animal Farm tutorial.
  * Had a refresher on basic fullstack fundamentals

## Structure
* A basic single page React.js application containing an instant search feature
* Uses HTTP server with Node.js (Express.js) to simulate backend

## Retrospection
* In the future, may consider attaching some modern UI framework components to improve the look and feel as a means to familiarise myself with React.

## Scripts

In the project directory, run:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Change to server directory and run `node .` to start Express.js backend server

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
